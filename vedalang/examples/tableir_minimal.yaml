# Minimal TableIR example: Combined Cycle Gas Turbine
# This defines a single thermal power plant with natural gas input and electricity output
#
# Note: This example demonstrates TableIR structure for the emitter.
# Full xl2times validation requires additional system tables (BookRegions_Map,
# TimeSlices, TimePeriods, etc.) - see fixtures/MiniVEDA2 for a complete example.
