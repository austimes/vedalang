Which says that we should use canonical attribute names only and never aliases. But then further down in the attributes and times mapping section, there's a mapping from the VedaLang field to the times attribute field. So there's a little bit of confusion here in that there are times attributes and Veda aliases for those attributes, and we don't ever want to use the aliases; only ever the canonical times attributes as is listed in the times attribute column of the attributes and times mapping section of the llms.md file. But then we have this thing called the VedaLang field which is just a human-readable version of the canonical times attribute. So it's never a human-readable version of one of the times attributes. So this is a little bit of nuance that probably needs to be expanded somewhere. So somewhere in the VedaLang syntax description, we just need to point out that the VedaLang fields are just long versions of the times attributes rather than anything to do with the aliases in Veda. If that makes sense, then create a BD issue for it and ask A Well then, just go ahead and implement it.
