  summary: |
    Transmission modeling works with the current VedaLang schema.
    It uses the same pattern as storage: process with energy input → energy output
    and efficiency < 1 to represent transmission losses.
    
  key_insights:
    - pattern: "Transmission is just a process converting energy→energy with efficiency loss"
    - commodities: "Different voltage levels are separate commodities (ELC_HV, ELC_MV, ELC_LV)"
    - losses: "Expressed via efficiency < 1 (e.g., 0.98 = 2% loss)"
    - no_special_veda_attrs: "No special VEDA attributes needed for basic transmission"
    
  validation_results:
    xl2times_status: success
    warnings: 1
    warning_detail: "MISSING_TIMESLICES (expected, not transmission-related)"
    errors: 0

    Minimal transmission model with:
    - 4 commodities: NG, ELC_HV, ELC_MV, ELC_LV
    - 3 processes: PP_CCGT (generation), GRID_HV_MV (98% eff), GRID_MV_LV (97% eff)
    - Demonstrates voltage hierarchy with cumulative 5% losses (HV→LV)

pattern_recommendation:
  add_to_patterns_yaml: true
  pattern_name: add_transmission_grid
  description: |
    Transmission processes convert between voltage/pressure levels with losses.
    Pattern is identical to thermal generation structurally:
      - Input: energy commodity at source level
      - Output: energy commodity at destination level  
      - Efficiency < 1 represents losses
    
  example:
    process_name: GRID_HV_MV
    input: ELC_HV
    output: ELC_MV
    efficiency: 0.98  # 2% loss

edge_cases_noted:
  - bidirectional_flow: "Current pattern is unidirectional; bidirectional would need two processes"
  - capacity_limits: "Transmission capacity constraints would use existing bound mechanisms"
  - distance_costs: "Investment costs per km would be modeled via cost parameters (not explored)"

next_steps:
  - Add transmission pattern to rules/patterns.yaml
  - Consider DC5 multi-region model (inter-regional transmission/trade)
  - Test with timeslices (peak vs off-peak transmission)
