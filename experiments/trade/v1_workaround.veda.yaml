# Experiment: Trade via Region-Specific Commodities (Workaround)
# This is NOT proper VEDA trade - just a modeling workaround

  regions:
    - REG1
    - REG2
  
  commodities:
    # Primary energy
    - name: NG
      type: energy
      unit: PJ
      description: Natural Gas
    
    # Electricity - conceptually should be tradeable between regions
    - name: ELC
      type: energy

    # Workaround: Region-specific "trade tokens"
    # This is ugly and doesn't capture proper VEDA trade semantics

  processes:
    # Normal generation in REG1

      sets: [ELE]
      activity_unit: PJ
      capacity_unit: GW
      inputs:
        - commodity: NG
      outputs:
        - commodity: ELC
      efficiency: 0.55
    
    # "Trade" process - this is the workaround
    # In proper VEDA this would be an IRE process with TOP_IRE topology

      sets: [DISTR]  # Should be IRE but using DISTR as workaround
      activity_unit: PJ
      capacity_unit: GW
      inputs:
        - commodity: ELC  # Takes electricity in REG1
      outputs:
        - commodity: ELC  # Delivers to REG2 (but VedaLang can't express this region change!)
      efficiency: 0.98  # 2% transmission loss

# CONCLUSION: This workaround FAILS to capture trade properly because:
# 1. VedaLang has no way to say "input from REG1, output to REG2"
# 2. The process topology is single-region
# 3. No TRADELINKS table is generated
# 
# VERDICT: Trade requires schema extension
