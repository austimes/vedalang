# VedaLang Demand Exploration - Version 1
# 
# Goal: Test if VedaLang can express final energy demands
#
# Hypothesis: 
# - Commodity type "demand" is supported (maps to DEM Csets)
# - Processes can output to demand commodities (topology works)
# - BUT: Demand LEVELS (COM_PROJ) are NOT expressible with current schema
#   - There's no scenario type for demand projections
#   - commodity_price maps to COM_PRICE, not COM_PROJ

  commodities:
    # Energy commodities
    - name: ELC

    # Demand commodity - this SHOULD work (type: demand → DEM in Csets)
    - name: RSD
      type: demand

      description: Residential electricity demand
  
  processes:
    # Demand process - converts electricity to demand service
    # In TIMES, demand processes typically have set "DMD" (demand devices)
    # They take energy input and produce demand output
    - name: DEM_RSD
      description: Residential demand device
      sets: [DMD]
      activity_unit: PJ
      capacity_unit: GW
      inputs:
        - commodity: ELC
          share: 1.0
      outputs:
        - commodity: RSD
          share: 1.0
      efficiency: 1.0  # No conversion losses in demand device
    
    # Supply process - provides electricity (minimal, just for completeness)
    - name: PP_GENERIC
      description: Generic power supply
      sets: [ELE]
      activity_unit: PJ
      capacity_unit: GW
      outputs:
        - commodity: ELC
          share: 1.0

  # NOTE: Cannot express demand projections here!
  # The scenarios section only supports "commodity_price" type.
  # To express demand trajectories, we would need something like:
  #
  # scenarios:
  #   - name: BaseDemand
  #     type: demand_projection  # <-- NOT IN SCHEMA
  #     commodity: RSD
  #     interpolation: interp_extrap
  #     values:
  #       "2020": 100.0
  #       "2030": 120.0
  #       "2040": 140.0
  #       "2050": 160.0
  #
  # This would need to emit ~FI_T rows with attribute=DEMAND (maps to COM_PROJ)
